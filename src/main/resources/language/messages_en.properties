title=First aid!
introduction.part1=What doesn't the device do?
introduction.part2=Throughout my professional career, I've realized that this is the most crucial question to start the diagnostics of any device. In this section, based on my extensive experience, I aim to provide the most concise and useful information and touch on primary diagnostic methods through examples of frequently occurring faults in specific devices.
introduction.part3=However, remember that all responsibility for decisions and actions based on the information provided lies with you. If you're unsure of your skills, I strongly recommend consulting with professionals.
introduction.part4=If nothing described on this page fits your query, you can always register and create a new topic. Together, we will surely come to the optimal solution.
tools=A reminder that for diagnosing most electronic devices, you will need tools such as screwdrivers, tweezers, plastic and metal spudgers; and all this is required just for disassembling the device.
diagnosis=For the primary diagnosis of the electronic part of the device, the minimum set includes a modern multimeter (basic knowledge of how to use it), a laboratory power supply, soldering equipment, flux, solder, etc. (a basic understanding of how to use all these). If all the above is unfamiliar to you, return to the point about consulting professionals!

section1.title=The device does not turn on:
section1.content.part1=To start, you need to determine what powers the device. Most modern electronic devices have an internal battery and are powered by an external power adapter.
section1.content.part2=This adapter converts AC from the socket into the DC voltage required by the device. The first step in diagnostics should be to replace this adapter (power supply/charger) with a known working one with exactly the same characteristics (the current can be higher but not lower, the voltage must be identical. In specific cases, a slight deviation in voltage is permissible.
section1.content.part3=If you are unsure about the correct replacement, create a new topicâ€”we will try to advise which power supply exactly suits you). The same applies to power cords/cables that have their own interfaces, usually USB typeA -> USB typeB, USB typeA -> miniUSB, USB typeA -> microUSB, USB typeA -> USB typeC, USB typeA -> lightning USB for Apple devices.
section1.content.part4=These cables should be replaced secondly. If none of the listed helped, it's time to disassemble the device. After disassembly, the first thing is to de-energize the device by disconnecting the battery from its corresponding connector, then conduct a thorough visual inspection of the motherboard for any damaged components on both sides of the motherboard,
section1.content.part5=also it is necessary to measure the working voltage of the battery to ensure it matches the voltage stated on the battery casing. These are general recommendations! For more specific cases, create the appropriate topic.
section1.content.part6=Please note that without proper experience, you should not attempt to diagnose devices and appliances that are directly powered by a 110/220-volt network. 
section1.content.part7=Such devices often contain switch-mode power supplies within, which should be diagnosed by an experienced specialist.
section1.content.part8=Unqualified intervention can lead to injuries and even fatal outcomes!

section2.title=What to do if moisture gets into the device?
section2.content.part1=In this section, we discuss several common scenarios of liquid intrusion into devices and the appropriate responses.
section2.content.part2=Users frequently encounter problems with "drowned" mobile phones. It's worth noting that many modern devices come with dust and moisture protection rated at IP67/IP68.
section2.content.part3=This classification means: "6" - full dust protection, "7" - short-term immersion up to 1 meter for approximately 30 minutes is permissible, "8" - the device can withstand prolonged submersion under water.
section2.content.part4=If your device has been exposed to moisture, it's crucial to first check if it has factory protection against moisture and dust. \
  The first step after such an incident should be to verify the device's factory moisture and dust protection. If your device is protected, gently wiping it with an absorbent cloth should suffice. \
  In 99% of cases, this will ensure the device remains fully functional.
section2.content.part5=The situation is more complicated if the manufacturer did not provide moisture protection. In this case, remember that time is of the essence. \
  The internal lithium-ion battery keeps components powered even when the device is off! Even a minimal amount of remaining moisture can cause electrochemical corrosion on the system board, connectors, flex cables, or display, inevitably leading to further device malfunction. \
  Signs of operability after moisture contact do not guarantee long-term stable operation upon further use. \
  Folk remedies like the "rice bath" or "placing on a radiator" prove ineffective and only waste precious time, exacerbating the consequences of moisture intrusion!
section2.content.part6=What actions can you take on your own?
section2.content.part7=Further actions depend on your skills. If you are not confident in your abilities, we recommend seeking a reputable service center. \
  There is a relevant section on this page on how to select such a service. The same applies if the device is glued together: it's not feasible to disassemble such a device at home without damaging it. \
  If, on the contrary, you are confident in your abilities, then proceed to disassemble the phone completely. Be extremely careful during disassembly and reassembly, paying close attention to which screws come from where, and make sure to remember how it was originally assembled by the manufacturer. \
  Often, screws vary in length, and inserting a screw in the wrong place can damage the system board or display module. \
  After complete disassembly, remove the system board and, having removed all peripherals, you can carefully examine the board for corrosion spots or their absence. \
  If you discover damages, you should create a relevant topic and upload quality photos. We will try to assess the damage and advise on further actions. \
  If no signs of water intrusion are found, you may proceed to partial reassembly and functionality testing. If water is present but corrosion spots have not yet formed, you should take a standard hair dryer and dry all removed components for 20 minutes on a medium temperature setting and at maximum air flow, paying special attention to the system board. \
  Please note that you need to be extremely careful with the display module and camera block. If no leaks, streaks, or other signs of moisture intrusion are found on them, it's better to set them aside for now. If such signs are present, replacement is likely necessary. \
  You may also attempt to dry them, but the air temperature of the dryer should be set to the lowest. However, it's likely that streaks will remain on the reflector of the display module, leading to image quality degradation, and condensation in the camera block will reduce the quality of pictures. \
  After ensuring no traces of moisture remain and all components have cooled to room temperature (especially the system board), you can begin partial reassembly of the device in reverse order, remembering to connect the battery last! \
  If the device powers on, be sure to check all functionality before fully reassembling it.
section2.content.part8=Laptops spilled with any liquid are also frequent "patients" of service centers! Overall, the action plan is similar to the above, but there are additional recommendations. \
  The first casualty in laptops upon moisture entry is the keyboard, and unfortunately, in such cases, the keyboard often becomes irreparably damaged and requires complete replacement. Moreover, in most modern devices, the keyboard is integrated into the top case, complicating its replacement and significantly increasing the cost. \
  Therefore, it's important to try to preserve the functionality of the factory keyboard. To do this, lay an absorbent cloth, such as a towel, on the table, open the laptop, and place it in an open position with the keyboard on the towel and the screen facing you. In this position, you need to power down the system board. \
  If the battery is removable, it should be the first thing to remove. If the battery is internal, then disassembly should be conducted in the position described above to ensure the natural flow of liquid out of the keyboard cavities through gravity. \
  The work regimen is similar to that described for phones. After complete disassembly, the top case with the keyboard or the removed keyboard should also be dried with a hairdryer. Be cautious with the temperature as keycaps can easily melt under high heat!
section2.content.part9=Timely and correct actions after moisture has entered the device can significantly increase the chances of saving it.
section2.content.part10=And the last recommendation in this section - never wipe the displays of monitors, televisions, and similar devices with a wet cloth. Moisture from the cloth accumulates between the display frame and the matrix, where flex cables of matrix decoders often reside, leading to complete matrix failure! \
  Screens should only be wiped with a soft dry cloth specifically designed for this purpose.



section3.title=What should I do if the device turns on, but there is no image?
section3.content.part1=This section is dedicated to laptops and desktop PCs. \
  If you've turned on your device only to find there's no display on the screen, and restarting doesn't help, there's no need to panic right away. First and foremost, a few standard procedures should be performed.
section3.content.part2=For laptops: remove the battery, all storage devices, and the BIOS battery, wait about 2-3 minutes, then try to start the device in this condition.
section3.content.part3=For PCs: connect to a known working monitor or TV using a verified cord (VGA, HDMI, DVI). \
  If your PC is equipped with a discrete graphics card and the CPU has an integrated graphics core, you should also remove the graphics card and try to output the display directly from the corresponding port located on the motherboard.
section3.content.part4=If the problem persists, there are several simple methods to localize the fault. \
  Such symptoms may indicate two different states of the device: lack of initialization and lack of display. \
  Even though both problems appear the same to the user - a black screen, the diagnostics methods will vary depending on what exactly is happening with your device.
section3.content.part5=How to determine what exactly the problem is? If you have followed the steps above, your device is now partially disassembled. \
  Turn it on and press the Ctrl+Alt+Delete keys. It's important that by this point, all storage devices, including USB, CD, SSD, HDD, have been disconnected from the device. \
  Observe the device's behavior after pressing the keys. If it restarts, it indicates that the initialization is successful, and the problem lies in the absence of a display. This method is suitable for both PCs and laptops.
section3.content.part6=Another way is to do all of the above, but before turning it on, insert any USB storage device with an indicator that flashes when reading data. \
  Turn on the device with the connected storage and watch the indicator. If it starts flashing, it means the initialization goes through, and the problem is related to the display output. \
  In most cases, in such a state, the laptop will output the image to an external screen, and a PC - to a known working monitor through any of the available interfaces.
section3.content.part7=If there are no signs of initialization, you may try removing the RAM and starting the device with just one module if there are several, or gently clean the memory contacts with an ordinary eraser if there's only one. \
  With each attempt, try using different slots for the memory, which often solves the problem.
section3.content.part8=In conclusion, remember that you can always create a topic on our forum, where we can examine your specific case in more detail.
